# HandSignDetection
Hand Gesture Image Capture:

The code uses the OpenCV library to access the webcam feed using cv2.VideoCapture(0).
It employs the HandDetector class from the cvzone.HandTrackingModule to detect and track a single hand in the video stream.
The region of interest (ROI) around the detected hand is cropped from the captured frame and stored in imgCrop.
The cropped ROI is resized to a fixed size (imgSize) and placed on a white canvas (imgWhite) to ensure consistent input dimensions for classification.
Hand Gesture Classification:

The resized hand gesture image is passed through a pre-trained classifier model loaded from "Model/keras_model.h5".
The classifier model, implemented in the Classifier class from cvzone.ClassificationModule, uses the model file and associated labels file ("Model/labels.txt") to predict the class label of the hand gesture.
The predicted class label, along with its corresponding index, is stored in prediction and index variables.
The class label and a bounding box visualization are overlaid on the original image frame (imgOutput).
User Interaction and Output:

The code continuously loops, capturing frames from the webcam and processing them for hand detection and classification.
The hand gesture image (imgCrop) and the processed image with the hand gesture overlay (imgWhite and imgOutput) are displayed in separate windows using cv2.imshow().
The predicted class label is printed to the console.
Project Report:

This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger project focused on hand gesture recognition and classification. The project aims to capture hand gestures in real-time using computer vision techniques and classify them using a pre-trained deep learning model.

The main components of the project include:

Data Collection: The initial code block allows the user to capture hand gesture images by showing the user's hand in front of the webcam. These images are stored in a specified folder, Data/C, for further analysis and model training.

Hand Detection: The code uses the HandDetector class to detect and track a single hand in the webcam feed. It provides the bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h) for the detected hand.

Gesture Image Preprocessing: The captured hand region is cropped and resized to a fixed size (imgSize). The aspect ratio is maintained while resizing, and the resulting image is placed on a white canvas (imgWhite) for consistent input dimensions.

Gesture Classification: The resized hand gesture image is passed through a pre-trained classifier model (keras_model.h5) for gesture classification. The Classifier class is responsible for loading the model and associated labels. The predicted class label and its index are obtained.

Visualization: The original image frame (imgOutput) is overlaid with the bounding box and the predicted class label. This annotated image is displayed in a window.

Overall, the project aims to enable real-time hand gesture recognition and classification using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The captured hand gesture images can be used to train and fine-tune the classifier model, enabling accurate recognition of different hand gestures.

It's important to note that the provided code is only a part of the complete project. The remaining code, which includes model training, dataset creation, and integration with other functionalities, is not provided.
